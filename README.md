Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices (Yasar, 2023).

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering integrates engineering principles, project management, quality assurance, and a systematic methodology to produce robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

Software engineering and traditional programming differ significantly in scope, approach, and methodologies. Traditional programming focuses primarily on writing code to solve specific problems or complete particular tasks. It involves directly implementing algorithms and functions to achieve desired outcomes, often without a comprehensive consideration of the broader system's architecture or long-term maintenance. Traditional programming is typically a more isolated activity, where individual coders or small teams work on specific modules or features, emphasizing coding efficiency and immediate functionality.

In contrast, software engineering encompasses a holistic, systematic approach to the entire software development lifecycle. It involves not only writing code but also includes planning, designing, testing, and maintaining software systems. Software engineering integrates principles from engineering, project management, and software development to ensure that software products are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. It considers aspects such as requirements analysis, architectural design, user experience, and long-term maintenance. Software engineers work in larger, often interdisciplinary teams and use structured methodologies and tools to manage complex projects, ensuring that the final product meets specified requirements and quality standards over its entire lifecycle.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several distinct phases that guide the process of developing software from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. The first phase is Planning and Requirement Analysis, where the project's objectives and scope are defined. During this phase, stakeholders' needs are gathered and analyzed to establish clear, comprehensive, and feasible requirements. This involves identifying the software's purpose, the problem it aims to solve, and its expected functionalities. Effective planning and requirement analysis lay the foundation for a successful project by ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals.

Next is the Design and Development phase, where the software's architecture and detailed design are created based on the requirements. This phase involves both high-level system design and detailed design of individual components. The architecture design defines the overall structure and the technologies to be used, while the detailed design specifies how each component will function and interact with others. Once the design is approved, the development team begins coding the software. This involves writing the actual source code according to the design specifications, ensuring that it meets the established requirements and standards.

The final phases include Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Testing involves various levels such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing to identify and fix bugs, ensuring the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. After successful testing, the software is Deployed to a production environment where it becomes available to users. Maintenance follows deployment and involves ongoing support to fix any issues that arise, update the software to adapt to changing needs, and improve performance. This phase ensures the software remains functional, secure, and relevant over time, addressing user feedback and technological advancements. Each of these phases is crucial for delivering a high-quality software product that satisfies user needs and operates reliably.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves several key processes aimed at identifying, documenting, and managing the requirements of a software system. The main steps in requirement engineering include:
Requirement Elicitation: This involves gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, observations, and document analysis. The goal is to understand what the stakeholders need from the system.
Requirement Analysis: In this step, the gathered requirements are analyzed to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible. This process may involve creating models, prototypes, and use cases to better understand the requirements.
Requirement Specification: The analyzed requirements are documented in a formal requirements specification document. This document typically includes functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.).
Requirement Validation: The requirements specification is reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure it accurately reflects their needs and expectations. Techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes are used for validation.
Requirement Management: This involves tracking and managing changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle. It ensures that any changes are systematically evaluated, approved, and documented, and that all stakeholders are kept informed of changes.


Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to dividing a software system into distinct, manageable units or modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. This approach significantly improves the maintainability and scalability of software systems through several key benefits:

Improved Maintainability:
Isolation of Changes: Modularity allows developers to make changes in a specific module without affecting others, making it easier to update, fix bugs, or add new features.
Simplified Debugging: Since each module is independent, identifying and resolving issues becomes more straightforward, reducing the time and effort required for debugging.
Enhanced Readability and Understandability: Smaller, well-defined modules are easier to understand, which simplifies the onboarding process for new developers and aids in ongoing maintenance.
Enhanced Scalability:
Independent Development: Different teams can work on separate modules simultaneously without interfering with each other, speeding up the development process and enabling parallel progress.
Easier Integration of New Features: New functionality can be added by developing new modules or updating existing ones without reworking the entire system, facilitating incremental scaling.
Resource Optimization: Modules can be deployed independently, allowing for better allocation of resources based on specific needs, and enabling load balancing and distribution across multiple servers or services.
By promoting a structured and organized approach to software development, modularity ensures that systems are easier to manage, evolve, and expand over time.
